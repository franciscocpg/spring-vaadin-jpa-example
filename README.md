=========================

Example of Spring 3 + Spring Security 3 + Vaadin 7 + JPA(Hibernate) + Envers + Joda Time web application

This is just an example how those framework and libraries can work together quite nicely:
- Spring 3 for DI and other nice stuff
- Spring Security for auth*
- Vaadin for UI
- JPA with Hibernate as implementation for ORM
- Envers for Auditing
- Joda Time to cover that old ugly Date API

Just download, compile and run, it's only an example and didn't had a lot of time so don't expect unit tests, a lot of comments, etc.
